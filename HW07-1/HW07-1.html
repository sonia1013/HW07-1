    <h2>Studying Foreign Languages</h2>
    <div class="slg">
      <p>Every foreign language has its own momentum.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The more you learn, the more you want to learn. Say you love Italian food and decide to study Italian. At first it's hard. But one day you meet some Italian tourists on the bus and you understand enough to point them towards their hotel. Before you part ways, they give you their e-mail address. Now you can easily communicate with them and study some more.
